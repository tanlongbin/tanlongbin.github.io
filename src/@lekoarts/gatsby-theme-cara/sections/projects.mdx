\- Main internship project at Singapore Airlines IT Division.  
\- Created an automated process to retrieve deployment information of the various automation softwares that are currently running and consolidating them into a near real time opearational dashboard on Tableau.  
\- Information were retrieved from the SQL server using exposed API.  
\- The information is then consolidated in Microsoft Excel using VBA, before being updated into an Microsoft Access database.  
\- The operational dashboard is created in Tableau and links to the Access database to visualize the neccessary information.
